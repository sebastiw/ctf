# Hack AI 2023 CTF event

In this event we will play a (digital) capture the flag game.
We will use this [website](https://247ctf.com/dashboard) that contains a collection of different challenges from different disiplines (for example: networking, crypto, web etc).

Each challenge is different and we the organisers have not solved them before

## Teams

We recommend you would work with a team in this event, but it is also possible to take part alone. Feel free to work in your current hackday teams or also teamup with others if you like.

Each team should come up with a team name that will be used for counting points.

## Point system

Each challenge has its own points attached to it, we will use this point system for grading the challenges

## Submiting results

Each team should create a thread in #hackday channel and submit screenshots of the solved challenges they solved (or a screenshot of the points of the account used)

## Tools

There are no limit to the tools you can use,
some challenges might require having 3rd party tools like the reversing challenges

## Have fun and enjoy hacking!
